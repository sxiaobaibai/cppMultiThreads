# Simple C++ realtime multi threads

## basic usage
This is a header only soft realtime multi thread program.
By using this program, you can choose multiple sample frequencies for multiple threads.
For example, you can set frequencies such as 0.1ms for basic controller, 1.0ms for uppper layer's controller, aperiodic displaying function separately and so on. 

Here is how to use the code.
Firstly, include the headers.
```
#include "/path/to/multi_thread.h"//the header file is located in ./inc/
#include "/path/to/thread_timer.h"//the header file is located in ./inc/
```
Create an instance of thread_timer object and MultiThread object.
```
thread_timer timer(1);// The basic sample frequency is 1s
Multithread<thread_timer> threads(timer);
```

Add function which you want to call at each sample frequency()
```
void test()
{
	//Do something.
}
threads.add_thread(test, 10);//call test function at each 10s.
```

Finish task.
```
threads.exec();
threads.join_all();
```

## Define your own timer
Example of defining different timer will be as follow.
```
struct highResolutionTimer: public thread_timer
{
	highResolutionTimer(float tick):thread_timer(tick){}
	virtual void step()
	{
		// write code to make system wait thick_ second.
		// one example will be usleep(1000); //wait 1ms.
		// if you want to implent a higher frequency system, you should inherit thread_timer class and define your own class.
	}
};
```

## Example
An example code is located in the directory of ./example/.
In the main.cc, five threads are created.
The five threads are called at different frequency.
(Be carefull that this example does not consider mutual exclusion for the std::vector object.)
The way of executing the example program is as follow.
```
cd example/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./example
```
